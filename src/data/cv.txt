 Summary
 Computer Science undergraduate specializing in Intelligent Systems who translates complex algorithms into
 practical, user-facing software. I combine published applied ML research (co-author at ICCSCI 2025) with
 end-to-end development experience from a deployed MERN full-stack soundscape app to ML-powered tools and
 GUIs. Preparing for Apple Developer Academy 2026, aiming to pivot into mobile/iOS engineering while bringing
 strong product sense and advanced Mandarin proficiency for cross-cultural collaboration.

 Experience
 Laboratory Teaching Assistant
 BINUS University (Bina Nusantara University)
 Sep. 2024– Jan. 2025
 Malang, Indonesia
 • For the Algorithm and Programming course, led weekly hands-on lab sessions for over 60 students, teaching
 fundamental concepts of algorithms and programming logic in C.
 • For the Commercializing Emerging Technology course, collaborated with the lead lecturer to conduct weekly
 lab sessions for over 40 students, guiding them on the practical application of emerging technology for business
 model creation.
 Projects & Research
 Enhancing Decision Tree Performance through Stacking Ensemble Learning
 Feb. 2025– Jul. 2025
 • Co-authored a peer-reviewed paper published at ICCSCI 2025 (Scopus Q2). Served as primary technical writer.
 • Collaborated on model evaluation and result interpretation for a stacking ensemble (Decision Tree + SVM),
 contributing analysis that highlighted improvements in sentiment classification accuracy (73.46% → 88.08%).
 • Contributed to literature review and framing of findings, emphasizing the accuracy–interpretability trade-off in text
 classification.
 DoodleDetect– Sketch Recognition Desktop App
 Feb. 2025– Jul. 2025
 • Served as lead technical writer, producing detailed documentation of a hybrid pipeline (CLIP + SVM + FAISS)
 that outperformed a VGG-16 baseline (77.2% vs 69.4% Top-1 accuracy).
 • Independently deployed the trained model into a Tkinter-based desktop GUI, enabling users to draw, classify, and
 view predictions in real-time.
 • Delivered an interactive tool demonstrating how classical ML with strong embeddings can outperform deep
 networks in resource-constrained tasks.
 Feb. 2025– Jul. 2025
 CeritaNusa– AI-Powered Indonesian History Learning App
• Built the admin dashboard in React.js to manage historical content and quizzes for an NLP-powered summarization
 feature (BERT).
 • Integrated CRUD workflows to support content team, forming a key part of the MLOps pipeline for model
 deployment.
 • Contributed to system evaluation through Blackbox and User Acceptance Testing, improving stability from 1
 failure/7 tests (v1.0) to 0 failures/8 tests (v1.3)
 Nagiscape– Full-Stack Ambient Sound Mixer (MERN Stack)
 Jul. 2025– Aug. 2025
 • Developed and deployed a full-stack web application for personalized ambient soundscapes, built with React,
 Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and hosted on Vercel.
 • Implemented secure authentication with JWT, password reset via email, and account management features.
 • Engineered dynamic audio mixing with a responsive, glassmorphism-style interface; enabled users to save and load
 custom sound “mixes.”
 Activities
