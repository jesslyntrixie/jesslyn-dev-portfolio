# Contact Form Setup Guide

Your contact form now has **real email functionality**! Here are your options:

## ðŸš€ Current Status
- âœ… **Working Form**: Form is functional with fallback to mailto
- âœ… **EmailJS Ready**: Code is ready for EmailJS integration
- âœ… **Fallback**: If EmailJS isn't configured, it opens default email client

## ðŸ“§ Option 1: EmailJS (Recommended)
**Best for: Professional portfolios, reliable email delivery**

### Setup Steps:
1. **Sign up at [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)**
2. **Create Email Service** (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
3. **Create Email Template** with these variables:
   ```
   From: {{from_name}} <{{from_email}}>
   Subject: {{subject}}
   
   Hi {{to_name}},
   
   You received a new message from your portfolio:
   
   Name: {{from_name}}
   Email: {{from_email}}
   Subject: {{subject}}
   
   Message:
   {{message}}
   ```
4. **Get your credentials** from EmailJS dashboard
5. **Create `.env.local`** file in your project root:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_xxxxxxx
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_xxxxxxx  
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

### Benefits:
- âœ… Professional email delivery
- âœ… No server required
- âœ… Reliable spam protection
- âœ… Email templates
- âœ… Free tier available (200 emails/month)

## ðŸ“® Option 2: Current Fallback (Already Working)
**Best for: Quick deployment, simple solution**

The form currently works by opening the user's default email client with pre-filled information. This works immediately without any setup!

### How it works:
- User fills the form
- Clicks submit
- Their email client opens with your email and the form data
- They send the email manually

## ðŸ”§ Option 3: Next.js API Route + Email Service
**Best for: Full control, custom logic**

If you want a custom backend solution, you can:
1. Create `/pages/api/contact.js` 
2. Use services like SendGrid, Nodemailer, or Resend
3. Handle form submission server-side

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation
Start with **EmailJS** - it's perfect for portfolios, professional, and works without a backend server. The setup takes 10 minutes and gives you reliable email delivery.

- âœ… **Professional design**
